# About Me
I am an experienced customer service professional. I enjoy solving complex problems and assignments from customers. I possess empathy and high soft skills. While working I constantly needed html, css, js knowledge and skills. The more I immersed myself in this area, the more I realized that I enjoyed development. And now I am at the stage of learning in the direction - front-end development. Looking forward to transitioning to a career in development where I can utilize my problem solving skills and critical thinking.
